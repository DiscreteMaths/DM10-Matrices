A geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the \textit{\textbf{common ratio}}. 

\noindent For example, the sequence $2, 6, 18, 54, \ldots$ is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. 

\noindent Similarly $10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, \ldots$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %



\noindent Examples of a geometric sequence are powers $r_k$ of a fixed number r, such as 2k and 3k. The general form of a geometric sequence is
\[a,\ ar,\ ar^{2},\ ar^{3},\ ar^{4},\ \ldots \]
where $r \neq 0$ is the common ratio and $a$ is a \textit{\textbf{scale factor}}, equal to the sequence's start value.

\textbf{Summations of Geometric Progressions}
A summation of a geometric progression, a \textit{\textbf{geometric series}}, is the sum of the numbers in a geometric progression. For example:
\[2+10+50+250=2+2\times 5+2\times 5^{2}+2\times 5^{3}.\,\]

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %

Letting $a$ be the first term (here 2), $m$ be the number of terms (here 4), and r be the constant that each term is multiplied by to get the next term (here 5), the sum is given by:
\[{\frac  {a(1-r^{m})}{1-r}}\]
In the example above, this gives:
\[2+10+50+250={\frac  {2(1-5^{4})}{1-5}}={\frac  {-1248}{-4}}=312.\]
